thou_hast_been
==============

End users allow mobile device to regularly send GPS coordinates and other usage data such as photos, photos' time taken, photo's location where taken to thou_hast_been and enjoy looking at compiled data in some fashion on the web app.

The web app will likely have a map and a date range picker and display the user's travel routes over that date range and thumbnails of the photos they took at the location on the map where they took them. Clicking on photos should enable viewing at a large scale and inform the user the datetime they were taken. The route may, in the future have a gradient color to show the progress of travel over the time range.

Instructions to start developing:

1. install nodejs
2. install nodemon globally
3. run nodemon index.js

Reasons why this might be cool:
1. People might like to see a map with thumbs of all their photos they took over a given date range.
2. People can browse important moments from their past without piecing together the data themselves.
3. With a moving enough set of promo junk and visual asthetics people will be drawn to any application.
