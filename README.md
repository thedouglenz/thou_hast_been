thou_hast_been
==============

End users allow mobile device to regularly send GPS coordinates and other usage data such as photos, photo's time taken, photo's location where taken to thou_hast_been and enjoy looking at compiled data in some fashion on web app and on their devices too. A map, perhaps, where their photos from a given time range appear on the map in the locations of their takings. More ideas will follow once something is going.

Instructions to start developing:

1. install nodejs
2. install nodemon globally
3. run nodemon index.js

Reasons why this might be cool:
1. People might like to see a map with thumbs of all their photos they took over a given date range.
2. People can browse important moments from their past without piecing together the data themselves.
3. With a moving enough set of promo junk and visual asthetics people will be drawn to any application.
